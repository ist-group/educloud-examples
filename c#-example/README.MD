# Educloud .Net Example

This is a quick demo app for authencation and fetching data from Educloud in .Net. The console app will get all organisations for a customer and print out Id and Name of each organisation. 

## Authentication 
To use the API we need an authentication token from SkolId. 

Set the values in the appsettings.json file to match your clientId/secret

## Customisation
In program.cs line 23 you have a variable that contains the id of a customer. Change this to match the customer you want to work with. SE00100 is the id of the demo customer.
